Tools for Spatial Audio and Virtual Reality

This is the git repo for Casey Celestin's senior project.
The project is a research into spatialized sound and virtual reality. 
Included are two short papers, one a general overiew of the project, the other a deeper look into the concept explored through the project.
The virtual reality tool is the culmination of one semesters work, a Max patch that allows users to import audio tracks, it then visualizes the tracks as spheres in a VR space for the user to manipulate each sphere's position.

The future of this project is to create a virtual sound art instillation.

Many thanks to my advisors Konrad Kaczmarek and Scott Petersen at Yale University.
