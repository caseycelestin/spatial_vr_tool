## Spatial VR Tool  

## Tools for Spatial Audio and Virtual Reality for the Purpose of Music Creation
#### Casey Celestin
#### Open Music Initiative ([OMI Yale](https://omi.yale.edu))

This is the git repo for Casey Celestin's senior project.

The project is a research into spatialized sound and virtual reality. 
The virtual reality tool is the culmination of one semesters work, a Max patch that allows users to import audio tracks, it then visualizes the tracks as spheres in a VR space for the user to manipulate each sphere's position.
Also included are two short papers, one a general overview of the project, the other a deeper look into the concept explored through the project.

The future of this project is to create a virtual sound art instillation and will be updated regularly as the project progresses.

Many thanks to my advisors Konrad Kaczmarek and Scott Petersen at Yale University.
